## About This Project

This repository hosts unofficial, community-provided translations for the game [Ricave](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942680/Ricave/). The goal is to make the game accessible to a wider audience by providing localization files for various languages that are not yet officially supported.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
All translations in this repository are generated using AI language models. They are provided "as-is" and have **not** been manually proofread by native speakers.

-   **Expect Errors:** These translations will likely contain mistakes, awkward phrasing, or contextual errors.
-   **Not Official:** These files are not created or endorsed by the developers of *Ricave*.
-   **Use at Your Own Risk:** While these files should not cause any harm to your game, they are used at your own discretion.

## How to Use the Translations

To use one of the translations, you need to download the language folder and place it into the correct directory in your game's installation folder.

### 1. Locate the Game Folder

You can easily find the game's installation folder through the Steam client:

1.  Open your **Steam Library**.
2.  Right-click on **Ricave** in your game list.
3.  Go to **Manage** > **Browse local files**.

This will open the main game folder. From there, navigate to the `Data\Languages` directory. The final path should look like this:
```
SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Ricave\Data\Languages
```

### 2. Download and Place the Language Folder

1.  In this GitHub repository, browse to the folder of the language you want to install (e.g., `Chinese (Simplified)`).
2.  Download the entire folder. The easiest way is to click the green **<> Code** button at the top of this page and select **Download ZIP**.
3.  Unzip the downloaded file.
4.  Copy the language folder (e.g., `Chinese (Simplified)`) into the `...\Ricave\Data\Languages` folder you located in the previous step.

### 3. Select the Language In-Game

1.  Launch *Ricave*.
2.  On the main menu, click the **language button** located in the bottom-right corner of the screen (it will initially say "English").
3.  Select your desired language from the list that appears.

The game's text should now be displayed in the selected language.
